## Outline

1.  One-way sensitivity analysis.
2.  Examples from publications.
3.  Two-way sensitivity analysis.
4.  Examples from publications.
5.  Limitations and extensions.
6.  Scenario analysis
7.  Threshold analysis

# One-way sensitivity analysis {background="#43464B"}

## One-way sensitivity analysis

::: incremental
-   Usually the starting point for sensitivity analyses
-   Sequentially testing one variable at a time (i.e., Age, BMI, QALY, other clinically important parameters), while holding everything else constant
-   Determining how this variation impacts the results
-   One-way sensitivity analyses are often presented in a **tornado diagram**
    -   Used to visually rank the different variables in order of their overall influence on the magnitude of the model outputs

# Two-way sensitivity analysis {background="#43464B"}

## Two-way sensitivity analysis

::: incremental
-   A way to map the interaction effects between two parameters in a decision analysis model
-   Varies 2 parameters at a time
-   Explores the robustness of results in more depth

# Examples from publications

## HIV prevention

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-28%20at%209.54.01%20AM.png){width="517"}

## HIV prevention

::: incremental
-   Markov model examining strategies for HIV prevention among serodiscordant couples seeking conception (woman does not have HIV and male has HIV)

-   We know that if the **male partner is consistently on medication for HIV** (i.e., resulting in virologic suppression), then the risk of transmission is small regardless of the woman taking PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis)

-   And we also know that PrEP has traditionally been really **costly**

## Financial incentives for acute stroke care

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-28%20at%2010.25.53%20PM.png){width="543"}

## Financial incentives for acute stroke care

::: incremental
-   Under pay for performance policies in the US, **physicians or hospitals are paid more for meeting evidence-based quality targets**

-   Study objective: Illustrate how pay-for-performance incentives can be quantitatively bounded using cost-effectiveness modeling, through the **application of reimbursement to hospitals for faster time-to-tPA for acute ischemic stroke**
:::

## Financial incentives for acute stroke care

> When administered quickly after stroke onset (within three hours, as approved by the FDA), tPA helps to restore blood flow to brain regions affected by a stroke, thereby limiting the risk of damage and functional impairment

# Limitations of deterministic sensitivity analyses {background="#43464B"}

## Caution: Limitations!

-   Limited by the subjectivity of the choice of parameters to analyze
-   That's why we also run PSAs!, i.e., varying ALL input parameters at the same time, using priors to play a distribution around each value

# Opportunity to practice in Exercise!

# Scenario analysis

## Scenario analysis

-   Focuses more on model **assumptions** rather than parameter uncertainty
-   Could include separate analysis on:

> Subgroups/sub-populations, including different age cohorts & risk levels

<br>

> Different perspectives (societal; modified societal; etc)

## Scenario analysis

> Hypothetical scenarios ("optimistic" and "conservative" scenarios; for example, if we have little evidence of long-term survival associated with medication X, we might have an optimistic versus conservative scenario)

<br>

> Time horizons

# Threshold analysis

## Threshold analysis

-   Answers the question: What the input parameter need be to meet the country thresholds of:
    -   \$50,000/QALY gained
    -   \$100,000/QALY gained
    -   \$150,000/QALY gained
    -   \$200,000/QALY gained
