# Learning Objectives and Outline

## Learning Objectives

-   Define treatment thresholds within a decision tree & examine
    different ways of interpretation

-   Understand and calculate the value of information from a perfect vs.
    imperfect test

## Outline

-   Treatment thresholds

-   Testing & Value of Information

::: notes
-   Let's start with the PULMONARY EMBOLISM example that we've looked at
    before & in our text

-   Pulmonary embolism (PE) during pregnancy is a life-threatening
    event. Treatment with anti-coagulation is effective in preventing
    further PE and hence in reducing the fatality probability.

-   The choices here are either to ANTICOAGULATE OR TO NOT ANTICOAGULATE
    & our main objective is to optimize survival

-   When we calculate out the probabilities, the overall expected
    survival chances with ANTICOAGULATION is 99%, compared to 95%
    WITHOUT ANTICOAGULATION

-   Therefore, we would, on average, choose to ANTICOAGULATE in this
    case because it has higher overall survival

-   BUT to be confident about our decision, we need to explore HOW our
    assumptions will affect the decision in sensitivity analyses

\*\*\*We will cover more on SA's later in the semester as it relates to
cost-effectiveness analysis

What if the probability of recurrent PE were higher or lower than
initially estimated?
:::

<br>

-   Do we anticoagulate or not?
-   At what point do we switch between "yes" versus "no"?

::: notes
-   I know we touched on this briefly in the last couple of lectures in
    various forms, but the key question that we always need to ask in
    any decision problem is AT WHAT POINT DO WE SWITCH BETWEEN OPTIONS?

-   In this case, what IF the probability of recurrent PE were higher or
    lower than initially estimated? would we still choose to
    anticoagulate? & at what point would we switch?

-   (And from a cost-effectiveness perspective, at more of a higher
    population level - what variations will ultimately change our
    decision) -- In this case, to anticoagulate versus not.

-   Parameters will always have confidence intervals around them & will
    also be uncertain depending on our assumptions in our model & the
    information that we have.

-   However, the more information we have on a certain
    disease/parameter, the more confidence we will have in our
    decisions.
:::

## Treatment thresholds

![](images/trt-threshold1.png)

::: notes
-   From more of a clinical standpoint --

-   Our THRESHOLD TO TREAT a patient is the point at which the expected
    value of treatment & no treatment are exactly EQUAL

    -   Another way to look at this (which we'll go over in the upcoming
        slides) is the RATIO of NET HARM of treating patients without
        the disease & BENEFIT gained by treating patients with the
        disease.

-   And if we incorporate DIAGNOSTIC TESTING as part of our
    decision-making, we can determine how a patient's risk might change
    based on the result of a particular test

    -   For example, if the test has no chance of moving the patient's
        risk above the treatment threshold, then the test should
        probably not be ordered. Because as we know, tests can also come
        with their own risks & costs.

> Perform a sensitivity analysis to find a treatment threshold

(More on sensitivity analyses later in the workshop)

::: notes
-   We would need to perform a sensitivity analysis to find the
    treatment threshold

    -   Similar to the "beach" example in the second class

## Treatment thresholds

[Expected value (AC) = 0.990 \* pPE + 0.992 \*
(1-pPE)]{style="color:green;"}

[Expected value (No AC) = 0.750 \* pPE + 1.0 \*
(1-pPE)]{style="color:blue;"}

NOW, SET EQUAL TO EACH OTHER, to solve for unknown threshold probability
:::

::: notes
-   To go back to our PE example,

-   A key parameter in our model is the probability of pulmonary
    embolism when we undergo anticoagulant treatment versus not.

-   If we set the EXPECTED VALUE OF AC VERSUS NO AC equal to each other,
    like we've done in previous examples, we can solve for the unknown
    threshold probability

    -   which is the point where the expected value of treatment and
        withholding treatment are exactly equal for this specific
        decision problem.

[0.240 \* pPE]{style="color:green;"} = [0.008 \*
(1-pPE)]{style="color:blue;"}

0.240 \* pPE + 0.008 \*pPE = 0.008

pPE = 0.008 / (0.240 + 0.008)

= .032

![](images/trt-threshold4.png)

::: notes
-   So, what does this mean?

-   If you put these probabilities for PE back into our model for each
    AC & no AC, then you'll get these survival probabilities

-   You can see the point in which our decision would change

-   If our pPE is EQUAL TO or LESS THAN .032, then we would prefer no AC
    to AC

-   But, as displayed in the second row, if our pPE is GREATER than
    .032, then we would prefer AC to No AC - bc higher overall survival
:::

## Treatment thresholds

![](images/trt-threshold5.png)

::: notes
-   When we go back to thinking about testing & how that might impact
    our decision to treat...

-   No tests should be done UNLESS the result of the test will change
    the treatment plan

    -   So, on the top bar -- the result of additional tests do not
        change our treatment plan
    -   Whereas, looking at the bar below, additional tests could in
        fact change our treatment plan

-   A key question we should be asking is - Is the risk of the test
    worth the benefit of getting it \*\*\*\* & this is something we can
    explore withing a decision analysis framework
:::

## Treatment thresholds

<br>

Performing a test to gain additional information is ONLY worthwhile IF:
<br>

(1) At least one decision would change given some test results, and/or\
    <br>
(2) The risk to the patient associated with the test is less than the
    expected benefit gained from undergoing the test

## Treatment thresholds

![](images/trt-threshold6.png)

::: notes
Same as before, but here, the additional information you gain on the top
bar, doesn't change your decision NOT to treat
:::

## Treatment thresholds

![](images/trt-threshold7.png){width="510"}

::: notes
You can look at test/treat thresholds the following way --

-   DO NOT TREAT & DO NOT TEST -- when even a positive test result will
    not persuade us to treat Ex. 95 year old, testing says you need a
    hip replacement. You're likely not going to get the surgery due to
    the risks regardless of the positive result.
-   TEST -- if the test will help us make a treatment decision
-   TREAT & DO NOT TEST -- when even a negative test result will not
    dissuade us from treating Ex.

**No Treat -- Test Threshold** <br> Probability of indifference between
testing & not treating

## Testing & expected value of information

<br>

::: incremental
-   Information can theoretically be perfect, free, & without risk, but
    it's usually NOT!
-   Information is almost always IMPERFECT
-   Getting information usually HAS A COST
:::

## Testing & expected value of information

<br>

::: fragment
Value of information asks: **what are we gaining by having this extra
information?**
:::

<br>

::: fragment
Value of information =

\|\[expected value from the 'gaining information' strategy\] --

\[expected value from the next best strategy\]\|
:::

## Testing & expected value of information

::: fragment
PERFECT tests give us an upper limit to the potential benefit from any
test
:::

<br>

::: fragment
The gain from such an imaginary PERFECT test is the expected value of
perfect information (EVPI)

case, the lower EV, the better since our outcome values are the
probability of a bad outcome), but not by much:
