# Learning Objectives and Outline

## Learning Objectives

-   Be able to understand the basic concepts and identify the strengths and limitations of
    alternative modeling techniques, including:

    ::: nonincremental
    -   Microsimulation (Monte Carlo simulation)

    -   Discrete event simulation

    -   Infectious disease (dynamic) models
    :::

## Outline

-   Microsimulation (Monte Carlo simulation)

-   Discrete event simulation

-   Infectious disease (dynamic) models

-   Comparison of model types

# Microsimulation

## Microsimulation models

-   Markov simulation

    -   Focuses on the average: essentially assuming infinite cohort of individuals
        transitions through the model simultaneously to obtain the expected values

-   Microsimulation

    -   Synonyms = stochastic microsimulation, individual-based model, 1st order Monte
        Carlo simulation

    -   Hypothetical individuals transition through the model, one at a time

## Steps {.smaller}

1.  Determine initial state, using the distribution of starting probabilities

    -   e.g. probability of starting in sick/healthy

2.  Simulate individual trajectory through health states, using **random numbers** to
    determine actual transitions (yes/no) from transition probabilities

3.  Record \# of cycles in each state

4.  Repeat steps 1-3 many times (N)

## Steps {.smaller}

5.  Calculate mean \# of cycles from sample of N

    -   Can weight states by utility, cost, discount factor (same as with Markov models)

## Random numbers

## Markov cohort vs Microsimulation

\[Shift to Powerpoint...\]

## Example

Context: Economic evaluation of TB prevention among people living with HIV in Tanzania

[![Zhu et al., The Lancet Global Health,
2022](images/paste-693A3914.png)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X22003722)

## Example

-   TB accounts for \>25% deaths among people living with HIV

-   Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) can prevent TB among people receiving
    antiretroviral therapy (ART)

-   HIV programmes are now initiating patients on ART with higher average CD4 cell counts
    and lower tuberculosis risks under test-and-treat guidelines

-   We aimed to investigate how this change has affected the health impact and
    cost-effectiveness of IPT

## Example

![Zhu et al, The Lancet Global Health, 2022](images/paste-893141CB.png)

## Example

::: {.callout-note .fragment appearance="simple"}
Why choose a microsimulation model?
:::

-   Individual-level characteristics on age, sex, CD4 cell count

-   Tracking individual trajectory is crucial for this question

    -   CD4 cell counts change with HIV treatment

    -   Event rates (mortality and TB progression rates) are dependent on CD4 cell counts

-   A markov cohort model wouldn't be able to capture these complex mechanisms!

# Discrete event simulation

## DES {.smaller}

::: {style="font-size: 0.95em"}
-   **Similar to microsimulation,** DES simulates one individual at a time $\rightarrow$
    Subject to stochasticity

-   **Different from microsimulation** (where time is discretized), DES models time
    continuously

-   **Pros:**

    -   Faster: Skips unnecessary cycles where no events happen

    -   More natural to implement when data are presented as time-to-event distributions
        (wait time, length of stay in hospital, onset-to-treatment time for acute
        conditions)

-   **Cons:**

    -   Less intuitive: "time to death is sampled from a Weibull distribution of shape =
        2.72, scale = 58.5" (DES) vs. "the probability of death in year 1 is 0.038"
        (Microsim)

    -   Those time steps may be useful even if there's no event! (In the HIV/TB example,
        CD4 cell count is updated every cycle to recalculate TB and death risks)

# Infectious disease (dynamic) models

## Why dynamic models?

-   So far all model types we discussed assume that individuals in the model cohort
    experience events independently

    -   Appropriate assumption for most chronic disease models

-   But what about infectious diseases (e.g. COVID) where individuals interact with each
    other?

    -   E.g. the risk of acquiring COVID for a healthy (susceptible) individual depends on
        how many individuals current have COVID in the population

## The SIR model

The most classic model in infectious disease epidemiology. Appropriate for many common
infectious diseases (e.g., the flu).

## The SIR model

![Source: Vynnycky, Emilia; White, Richard. An Introduction to Infectious Disease
Modelling.](images/paste-36EB7CF0.png)

## Variants of the SIR model {.smaller}

-   From the simple SIR process, we can add more stuctures to reflect the process of a
    particular disease, for example:

    -   Age- or sex- mixing: appropriate for sexually transmitted diseases

    -   A stage where individuals are infected but not infectious: appropriate for
        diseases with a latent stage, e.g., TB, COVID-19
