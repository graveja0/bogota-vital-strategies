# Decision Trees

## 

![](media/lec_conceptual-and-theoretical-frameworks/dt_beachhome1.png){fig-align="center"}

## Strengths

::: incremental
-   They are easy to describe and understand
-   Works well with limited time horizon
-   Decision trees are a powerful framework for analyzing decisions and
    can provide rapid/useful insights, but they have limitations.
:::

## Limitations

::: incremental
-   No explicit accounting for the elapse of time.
    -   Recurrent events must be separately built into model.
    -   Fine for short time cycles (e.g., 12 months) but we often want
        to model over a lifetime.
-   Difficult to incorporate real clinical detail - Tree structure can
    quickly become complex.

## At what probability ($p_B$) of rain for the beach are you indifferent between the two options? {auto-animate="true"}

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
::: incremental
-   Earlier, we solved for the expected payoff of remaining at home:
    0.74 (which was a lower expected value than going to the beach when
    the chance of rain at both was 30%) <br>

-   **What would** $p_B$ need to be to yield an expected payoff *at the
    beach* of 0.74?

    -   In other words, at what probability of rain at the beach would
        you be indifferent between staying at home & going to the beach?
:::
:::

::: notes
(1) Now, let's ask a slightly different question -- At what
    probabiility....
(2) Let's now assume that the probability of rain for the HOME option
    does not change (so stays at 0.3)
(3) KEY DIFFERENCE FROM THE LAST EXAMPLE: In the last example, the
    probabilities were the same & we wanted to get our threshold of
    indifference between the beach and staying at home
(4) \*\*Now we are assuming that there's still a probability of 30% that
    it rains if you stay home, but at what probability of rain at the
    beach would you be indifferent between the two options? (Since we
    CHOSE BEACH when the probabilities both equaled 30%)

-   In other words, at what probability of RAIN AT THE BEACH would you
    be indifferent between the beach & home
:::

## At what probability ($p_B$) of rain for the beach are you indifferent between the two options? {auto-animate="true"}

Set 0.74 (expected value of remaining at home) equal to the **beach**
payoffs and solve for $p_B$

<br>

p~B~ \* 0.4 + (1 - p~B~) \* 1.0 = 0.74

## At what probability ($p_B$) of rain for the beach are you indifferent between the two options? {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.fragment .fade-out}
p~B~ \* 0.4 + (1 - p~B~) \* 1.0 = 0.74
:::

::: incremental
p~B~ \* 0.4 + 1 - p~B~ = 0.74
:::

## At what probability ($p_B$) of rain for the beach are you indifferent between the two options? {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.fragment .fade-out}
p~B~ \* 0.4 + 1 - p~B~ = 0.74
:::

::: incremental
p~B~ \* -0.6 = -0.26
:::

## At what probability ($p_B$) of rain for the beach are you indifferent between the two options? {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.fragment .fade-out}
p~B~ \* -0.6 = -0.26
:::

::: incremental
p~B~ = -0.26 / -0.6 = [**0.43**]{style="color:green;"}
:::

## At what probability ($p_B$) of rain for the beach are you indifferent between the two options? {auto-animate="true"}

> When the probability of rain at the beach is 43% (probability of rain
> at home remains at 30%), we would be indifferent between staying at
> home & going to the beach.

> If the probability of rain at the beach in \> 43%, then we would stay
> home

## Parameter Uncertainty

-   Suppose we are not certain about the probability of fatal
    hemorrhage.

-   At what value of `p_fatal_hem` would expected survival be equal?

## Threshold Analysis: Idea

::: incremental
-   Allow the value of `p_fatal_hem` to vary over a range.

-   Find the value of `p_fatal_hem` along this range where expected
    survival is equal for the "Anticoagulant" and "No Anticoagulant"
    strategies.

# Example 2: Screening Program

## Screening Program

::: incremental
-   The Ministry of Health is considering implementation of a
    population-wide treatment program for a costly disease that affects a subgroup of the population.
-   The prevalence of the disease is not well-established.
:::

## Screening Program

::: incremental
-   An inexpensive screening test is available, but it is not perfect at
    detecting individuals with the disease.
-   A more expensive (perfect) diagnostic test is available.
:::

## Decision Problem

1.  Do nothing.
2.  Population screening with the inexpensive test.
3.  Expensive diagnostic test for everyone.

## Decision Problem

::: incremental
-   Given that we do not know the underlying probability of disease
    (`p_disease`), can we make a policy decision?
-   Perhaps! We can use a threshold analysis.
:::

## Threshold Analysis: Steps

::: incremental
1.  Allow `p_disease` to vary over a plausible range.
2.  Find the threshold at which we would be indifferent between:
  -   Do nothing vs. population screening with inexpensive test.
  -   Population screening vs. diagnostic test for everyone.

## Decision

- We can now solicit expert opinion on a likely range of the disease prevalance.
- If this range falls within the thresholds, we can make a decision despite uncertainty in the underlying disease prevalence.
