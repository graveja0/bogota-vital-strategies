::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Bayes theorem & the importance of incorporating information on testing,
including the value of this additional information
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Treatment thresholds and constructing decision trees within varying
software programs
:::

## Today... {background="#43464B"}

<br>

-   We will touch on some of the core concepts for representing [costs
    and health benefits]{style="color: #FF8966;"} within decision
    problems

::: notes
:::

## Economic Evaluation

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
::: incremental
-   Relevant when decision alternatives have different costs and health
    consequences.

-   We want to measure the relative value of one strategy in comparison
    to others.

-   This can help us make resource allocation decisions in the face of
    constraints (e.g., budget).

## Cost analysis

-   Only looks at healthcare costs

-   Relevant when alternative options are equally effective (provide
    equal benefits)

    -   Rarely the case in reality!

-   Costs are valued in monetary terms (e.g., U.S. dollars)

-   Decision criterion: often to minimize cost

## Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
Most useful when decision makers consider multiple options within a
budget, and the relevant outcome is common across strategies
:::

-   Costs are valued in monetary terms (\$)
-   Benefits are valued in terms of clinical outcomes (e.g., cases
    prevented or cured, lives saved, years of life gained)
-   Results reported as a cost-effectiveness ratio

## Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

::: incremental
-   Suppose we are interested in the prolongation of life after an
    intervention.

-   Outcome of interest: life-years gained.

-   The outcome is common to alternative strategies; they differ only in
    the magnitude of life-years gained.

-   We can report results in terms of \$/Life-years gained

## Cost-Utility Analysis

::: incremental
-   Essentially a variant of cost-effectiveness analysis.
-   **Major feature:** use of generic measure of health.
-   Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY): A metric that reflects both
    changes in life expectancy and quality of life (pain, function, or
    both).
-   By far the most widely published form of economic evaluation.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis {.smaller}

-   Also known as Benefit-Cost Analysis
-   Relevant for resource allocation between health care and other areas
    (e.g., education)
-   **Costs and health consequences are valued in monetary terms (e.g.,
    U.S. dollars)**
-   Valuation of health consequences in monetary terms (\$) is obtained
    by estimating individuals willingness to pay for life saving or
    health improving interventions.
    -   e.g. US estimate of value per statistical life \~\$9 million
-   Cost-benefit criterion: the benefits of a program \> its costs
    -   [Notice that we're not making comparisons *across*
        strategies--only comparisons of costs and benefits for the same
        strategy]{style="background-color: yellow;"}

## Back to Cost-Effectiveness Analysis!

<br>

-   Relevant when healthcare alternatives have different costs & health
    consequences <br>

::: fragment
$$ \frac{\text{(Cost Intervention A - Cost Intervention B)}}{\text{(Benefit A - Benefit B)}}$$
:::

-   Relative VALUE of an intervention in comparison to its alternative
    is expressed as a cost-effectiveness RATIO (the focus of next
    lecture!)

::: notes
(1) Cost-effectiveness analysis is relevant when healthcare alternatives
    between different services/interventions have DIFFERENT costs AND
    varying health consequences EXAMPLE: Different types of chemotherapy

(2) A KEY OUTCOME in cost-effectiveness analyses is what's called the
    ICER \[or incremental cost-effectiveness ratio\], which gives us the
    relative VALUE of an intervention compared to an alternative.

(3) In other words, THE PRICE PER UNIT BENEFIT of one intervention over
    the other

(4) We have 2 full classes on ICERs in the coming weeks & how to
    interpret these ratios across interventions What we will focus on
    TODAY is the components that make up the numerator (i.e. COSTS) &
    the denominator (i.e. BENEFITS)

(5) WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE - By estimating the magnitude of health
    outcomes and costs of interventions, cost-effectiveness analyses can
    show the trade-offs involved across interventions AND THEREFORE,
    hopefully contribute to better decision making

::: notes
When we look at how cost-effectiveness is used around the world --

Unlike the US, many country governments have their own institutional
bodies that conduct formal assessments on the cost-effectiveness of
drugs & devices -- some of which include:

(1) The UK - which is a single-payer system known as the NHS & has an
    independent body called NICE that evaluates the cost-effectiveness
    of health strategies for the NHS -- NICE recommends to the NHS what
    they should cover based on VALUE (i.e. cost-effectiveness).

-   & the NHS is legally obligated to fund medicines/treatments
    recommended by NICE

(2) Canada also has a health technology assessment body called the
    Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), which
    works in a similar way as NICE

(3) & likewise, Australia as well as Brazil, Germany, France, Italy,
    Sweden, the Netherlands, etc. all have similar government
    institutions

# CEAs: Identifying Alternatives

## Identifying Alternatives {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Decision modeling / economic evaluation requires identifying
    strategies or alternative courses of action.

-   These alternatives could include different therapies / policies /
    technologies.

-   Or, our alternatives could capture different combinations or
    sequences of treatment (e.g., what dose? what age to start?)
:::

::: fragment
::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Once we have identified the alternatives, we'll want to quantify their
associated consequences in terms of:

-   Health outcomes

-   Costs

## CEA components

<br>

$$ \frac{\text{(Cost Intervention A - Cost Intervention B)}}{\text{(Benefit A - Benefit B)}}$$

::: notes
(1) We will now get into the components of cost-effectiveness analyses
    by first looking at what comprises the NUMERATOR of the
    cost-effectiveness ratio & then delving into the DENOMINATOR

# Valuing Costs

## Valuing Costs: Steps {.smaller}

Source: Gold 1996, Drummond 2015, Gray 2012) <br>

1.  **Identify** -- Estimate the different categories of resources
    likely to be required (e.g., surgical staff, medical equipment,
    surgical complications, re-admissions) <br> <br>

2.  **Measure** -- Estimate how much of each resource category is
    required (e.g. type of staff performing the surgery and time
    involved, post-surgery length of stay, re-admission rates) <br> <br>

3.  **Value** -- Apply unit costs to each resource category (e.g.,
    salary scales from the relevant hospital or national wage rates for
    staff inputs, cost per inpatient day for the post-surgery hospital
    stay)

## We can [identify]{.underline} different types of healthcare costs {.smaller}

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
::: incremental
-   [**Direct Health Care Costs**]{style="color: #57886C"}

    -   Hospital, office, home, facilities

    -   Medications, procedures, tests, professional fees

-   [**Direct Non-Health Care Costs**]{style="color: #57886C"}

    -   Childcare, transportation costs

-   [**Time Costs**]{style="color: #57886C"}

    -   lost economic productivity due to death?

-   [**Unrelated healthcare costs**]{style="color: #57886C"}

    -   Cumulative trajectory of total healthcare costs over time
        (unrelated to medical interventions)
:::
:::

## Identifying costs (continued)

<br>

-   In practice, we count what is likely to matter

    -   Exclude what is likely to have little effect or equal effects
        across alternatives

-   Any exclusion must be noted & possible bias examined

-   We are constrained by what data are available

## We can [measure]{.underline} costs using different approaches {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   **Micro-costing (bottom-up)**

    -   Measure all resources used by individual patients, then assign
        the unit cost for each type of resource consumed to calculate
        the total cost

-   **Gross-costing (top-down)**

    -   Estimate cost for a given volume of patients by dividing the
        total cost by the volume of service use
    -   Example: Downstream costs (e.g., hospitalization due to opioid
        overdose)

-   **Ingredients-based approach (P x Q x C)**

    -   Probability of occurrence (P)

    -   Quantity (Q)

    -   Unit costs (C)
:::

::: notes
(1) Micro-costing: most precise (which is a bottom up approach where we
    measure, for instance, all the lab tests, hospital bed, provider
    time, imaging tests, equipment used, etc.)

(2) Gross-costing: Usually what we have to quantify "downstream costs"
    -- but we can also use this approach for costing out an intervention
    if we don't have the data for the micro-costing approach.

-   For example, if we know that 10 total knee replacements cost us
    \$300,000 last month, that's \$30,000 per procedure.

(3) Ingredients approach: Suppose we know that 10% of surgeries are
    complicated, and complicated surgeries require 50% more surgeon
    time, and surgeon time costs what \$500/hr

## Whose perspective?

Methodological Practices, and Reporting of Cost-effectiveness Analyses:

## Whose perspective?

<br>

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
PERSPECTIVE MATTERS -- <br> <br>

> **Formal Healthcare Sector:** Medical costs borne by third-party
> payers & paid for out-of-pocket by patients. Should include current +
> future costs, related & unrelated to the condition under consideration

> **Societal perspective:** Represents the wider "public interest" &
> inter-sectoral distribution of resources that are important to
> consider - reflects costs on all affected parties
:::

::: notes
(1) PERSPECTIVE really matters when you're deciding what costs to
    include in your analysis; we typically conduct CEAs from two
    different perspectives:

<!-- -->

(a) The formal healthcare sector perspective includes medical costs
    borne by third-party payers & paid for out-of-pocket by patients.
    Modelers should include current + future costs, related & unrelated
    to the condition under consideration.

-   Analysts have mostly used this perspective over the last 20 years
-   It is the most useful perspective to decision makers within the
    healthcare sector
-   As mentioned earlier NICE in the UK usually takes the perspective of
    the healthcare payer, whereas ICER tries to do analysis from both a
    formal healthcare sector & wider societal perspective

(b) Societal perspective includes everything in the formal health sector
    PLUS other things like time costs of patients seeking and receiving
    care, time costs of informal (unpaid) caregivers, transportation
    costs, effects on future productivity and consumption, and other
    costs and effects outside the healthcare sector.

<!-- -->

(2) The second panel on cost-effectiveness in health & medicine (the
    "gold standard" CEA recommendations in the US) recommends that
    studies be conducted from BOTH healthcare sector + societal
    perspectives so then we can more fully understand the wider
    implications of decision making.

**Healthcare sector perspective**

<br>

MAMMOGRAPHY (Healthcare Sector): <br>

-   Costs associated with the screening itself \[mammogram procedure +
    physician time\]

-   Costs of follow-up tests for both false-positive & true positive
    results

-   Downstream costs (or savings) associated with cases of breast
    cancer, such as: Hospitalization + treatment costs

-   Costs unrelated to medical intervention/disease; of living longer
    due to mammography

::: notes
(1) Let's look at an example - Mammography for breast cancer screening

(2) If we were going to cost this out from a Healthcare Sector
    perspective, we would need to account for:

-   Costs associated with the screening itself -- accounting for the
    costs of the procedure + clinician time

-   Costs of follow-up tests for both false-positive & true positive
    results

-   Downstream costs (or savings) associated with cases of breast
    cancer, including hospitalizations & treatment costs

\*\*\*EXAMPLE: Let's say that we wanted to examine the difference
between routine mammography screening at age 40 versus 50 -- - There
will be higher upfront costs for Age 40, BUT if we catch more cases of
breast cancer than if we waited, then that could potentially save a lot
of treatment/hospitalization costs down the line

LISA, BOOK says AVERTED COSTS for downstream costs

(3) Costs unrelated to the medical intervention due to living longer (we
    will discuss in the next few slides)

# Inflation Adjustment

## Inflation Adjustment: Motivation

<br>

-   \$100 in 2000 is not equivalent to \$100 in 2020

    -   \$100 could buy a lot more in 2000!

-   Important to adjust for the price difference over time, especially
    when working with cost sources from multiple years

## Inflation Adjustment: Example {.smaller}

## Inflation Adjustment: Method {.smaller}

-   Choose a reference year (usually the current year of analysis)

-   Convert all costs to the reference year

::: fragment
Converting cost in Year X to Year Y (reference year):

$$
    \textbf{Cost(Year Y)} = \textbf{Cost(Year X)} \times \frac{\textbf{Price index(Year Y)}}{\textbf{Price index(Year X)}}
$$

<br>

> Cost of hospitalization for mild stroke in the US was \~15,000 USD in
> 2016. What if we want to convert this number to 2020 USD?

-   PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure Health Price Index) in 2016:
    105.430 [(second column of Table 3 (PCE,
    health)](https://meps.ahrq.gov/about_meps/Price_Index.shtml)

-   PCE in 2020: 112.978

::: fragment
$$
\textbf{Cost(2020)} = \textbf{Cost(2016)} \times \frac{\textbf{PCE(2020)}}{\textbf{PCE(2016)}} \\
= 15,000 \times \frac{112.978}{105.430} \\
= 16,674 \ (\text{2020 USD})
$$

# Currency Conversion

## Currency Conversion

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
-   Isn't required for CEA but may be useful in some situations:

    -   Example: may need to convert local currency to USD because
        cost-effectiveness thresholds are often estimated in the unit of
        USD per DALY.

-   How do we convert 1,000 Nairas to USD?

-   Current exchange rate in 2023: 1 Naira = \~0.0013 USD

-   1,000 Nairas = 1.3 USD
:::

# Discounting

## Why discounting?

-   Adjust costs at social discount rate to reflect social "rate of time
    preference"

    -   Pure time preference ("inpatience")

    -   Potential catastrophic risk in the future

    -   Economic growth/return

## Discounting

<br>

![](images/discount.png)

::: notes
(1) If you have \$100 now, this could either be consumed or invested in
    the most profitable alternative (e.g., risk free government bond)

(2) Let's say the net return on the bond is 2%, then this means that
    next year the current \$100 has grown to \$102

(3) The "present value" of \$102 next year is \$100 today

(4) Similarly, \$100 next year = \$98.04 today

## Discounting

<br>

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
Inflation: We convert PAST cost to present-day values
:::

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
Discounting: We convert FUTURE costs to present-day values
:::

## How do we discount?

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
-   Present value: $PV = FV/(1+r)^t$

    -   FV = future value, the nominal cost incurred in the future

    -   r = **annual discount rate** (analogous to interest rate)

    -   t = number of years in future when cost is incurred

-   Reasonable consensus around 3% per year

-   May vary according to country guidelines

## Intuition

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
-   $r = 0.03$

-   Recall that $PV = FV/(1+r)^t$, and we're at Year 0:

    -   \$1 in Year 0 is valued as $1/1.03^0 = \$ 1$

    -   \$1 in Year 1 is valued as $1/1.03^1 = \$0.97$

    -   \$1 in Year 2 is valued as $1/1.03^2 = \$0.94$

    -   \$1 in Year 3 is valued as $1/1.03^3 = \$0.92$

    -   ...

    -   In other words, we are converting what a \$1 would be in Year 2,
        for example, to the PRESENT VALUE of today. Today, it will be
        0.94.
:::

::: notes
(1) We generally value future costs and effects less than current costs
    and effects AND their value diminishes the more distant into the
    future they occur

(2) Because we can invest in a dollar today to yield a higher return on
    investment later
:::

## Example

<br>

-   Assume in year 5, a patient develops disease, and there is a
    treatment cost of \$500
    -   This is the future value (FV) of the cost!
-   Present value PV = $PV = FV/(1+r)^t = 500/(1+0.03)^5 = \$ 431.3$
