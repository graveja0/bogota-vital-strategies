# Learning Objectives and Outline

## Learning Objectives

-   Understand the concepts of summary measures of health, specifically,
    quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)

-   Describe the general differences between direct and indirect methods
    for estimating health state utilities

-   Curate model parameters for quantifying "benefits" (the denominator
    in the CEA ratio)

## Outline

# ICER review {background="#43464B"}

$$
\frac{C_1 - C_0 \quad  (\Delta C)}{E_1 - E_0 \quad  (\Delta E)}
$$

## Numerator (costs)

Valued in monetary terms

<br> - E.g., <br> [\$USD / ₦NGN / KES / R]{style="color: #016301"}

## Denominator (benefits):

Valued in terms of **clinical outcomes**

<br> - E.g., <br> [\# of HIV cases prevented]{style="color: #016301"}
<br> [\# of children seizure free]{style="color: #016301"} <br> [\# of
quality-adjusted life years gained]{style="color: #016301"} <br>

-   What's important for the question at hand
-   Most analyses report several different outcomes
-   QALY/DALYs enable comparability across disease areas

# Valuing Health Outcomes

## Why summary measures of health?

-   QALYs and DALYs both provide a summary measure of health

-   Allow comparison of health attainment / disease burden

    -   Across diseases

    -   Across populations

    -   Over time etc.

## QALYs {.smaller}

-   Origin story: welfare economics

    -   Utility = holistic measure of satisfaction or wellbeing

-   With QALYs, two dimensions of interest:

    -   length of life (measured in life-years)

    -   quality of life (measured by utility weight, usually between 0
        and 1)

![](images/paste-A0D04843.png)

## QALYs

<br>

> QALY: A metric that reflects both changes in life expectancy and
> quality of life (pain, function, or both)

## QALYs {.smaller}

## Example: Patient with coronary heart disease [(with surgery)]{style="color: blue;"}

![](images/Slide1.png){fig-align="center"}

## Example: Patient with coronary heart disease [(without surgery)]{style="color: blue;"}

![](images/QALY graphs_3.png){fig-align="center"}

## Example: Patient with coronary heart disease

-   With surgery: 7.875 QALYs
-   Without surgery: 6.625 QALYs
-   Benefit from surgery intervention:
    -   In QALYs: 7.875 -- 6.625 QALYs = 1.25 QALYs

    -   In life years: 10 years -- 10 years = 0 LYs

## Utility weights -- How are they obtained? {.smaller}

<br>

-   Utility weights for most health states are between 0 (death) and 1
    (perfect health)

-   Direct methods

    -   Standard gamble

    -   Time trade-Off

    -   Rating scales

-   Indirect methods:

    -   EQ-5D

    -   Other utility instrument: SF-36; Health Utilities Index (HUI)

## Direct methods - Standard Gamble (SG) {.smaller}

-   Find the threshold $p$ that sets EV(A) = EV(B)
-   Assume respondent answered that they would be indifferent between A
    and B at a threshold of $pDeath$ = 0.10
-   Then **U(Amputation)** = $p$\*U(Death) + $(1-p)$\*U(Perfect Health)
    = 0.10\*0 + (1-0.10)\*1 = **0.9** = [threshold of indifference
    between surgery & no surgery (I will live with this rather than have
    a high risk of dying"\*\*\*)]{style="color: #E0A458;"}
:::
:::

::: notes
(1) The STANDARD GAMBLE technique asks patients (FOR EXAMPLE) - I WANT
    YOU TO IMAGINE

(2) Your leg gets amputated above the knee

(3) This doesn't impact your life expectancy, but you now live your life
    with an amputated leg

(4) Now, there's a NEW TREATMENT available where they can re-attach your
    leg

(5) But the treatment is RISKY & those undergoing it have a probability
    of dying

(6) The standard gamble technique asks you to find the THRESHOLD of
    indifference between SURGERY & NO SURGERY

(7) In other words, let's say you have a 30% probability of dying: Would
    you do the treatment?

-   What about a 20% probability of dying?

-   What about a 10%? - Ajay says yes, .90 is your utility value for the
    health state of living with an amputated knee Etc.

(8) Okay, I will live with this rather than have any high risk of
    dying"\*\*\*

This is the STANDARD GAMBLE TECHNIQUE

    -   Need some help bathing and dressing

    -   Need a cane or other device to walk

    -   Experience mild pain a few days per week

    -   Are able to work, with some modifications

    -   Need assistance with shopping, household chores, errands

    -   Feel anxious and depressed sometimes

    = 0.2\*0 + (1-0.2)\*1 = **0.8**
:::
:::

## Direct Methods - Time Trade-Off (TTO)

-   An alternative to standard gamble

-   Instead of risk of death, TTO uses time alive to value health states

-   Does not involve uncertainty in choices

-   Task might be easier for some respondents compared to standard
    gamble

## Direct Methods - Time Trade-Off (TTO) {.smaller}

U(Post-Stroke) \* 40 years = U(Perfect Health) \* 25 years + U(Dead) \*
15 years

U(Post-Stroke) \* 40 years = 1 \* 25 years + 0 \* 15 years

U(Post-Stroke) = 25/40 = 0.625
:::

## SG vs TTO

-   SG represents decision-making under uncertainty; TTO is
    decision-making under certainty

-   TTO might inadvertently capture time preference (i.e., we might
    value health in the future less than we do today) as opposed to only
    valuing the health states

-   Risk posture is captured in SG (risk aversion for death) but not in
    TTO

-   Utility values from SG usually \> TTO for same state

## Direct methods -- Rating scales

> "On a scale where 0 represents death and 100 represents perfect
> health, what number would you say best describes your health state
> over the past 2 weeks?"

-   Problem: It does not have the interval property we desire
    -   A value of "90" on this scale is not necessarily twice as good
        as a value of "45"

## Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)

The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a commonly-used rating scale

:::

## Direct methods -- Rating scales

-   Easy to use: Rating scales often used where time or cognitive
    ability/literacy prevents use of other methods
-   Very subjective and prone to more extreme answers! Usually,
    utilities for **VAS \< TTO \< SG**

-   System for describing health states

-   Valuations elicited through population based surveys with VAS, TTO

::: notes
(1) Indirect utility measures map preferences onto a utility scale via a generic health-related quality of life questionnaire
:::


## Indirect Methods
<br>

INDIRECT UTILITY MEASURES
<br>

-   HUI – Health Utility Index 
-   EQ5D – EuroQol health status measure 
-   SF-6D – Converts SF-36 & SF-12 scores to utilities 
-   QWB – Quality of well-being scale 

::: notes
(1) I’m not going to get into detail for each of these since you don’t need to know the granularity of each right now until you start exploring for your studies in the future, but just as an overview of some of the more well-known ones: 

(2) HUI (Health Utility Index), based on a large, Canadian community sample (copyrighted, not free to use), patients are asked to consider their health over the past 2, 3, & 4 weeks 

(2) EQ5D, European & US-based, asks participants to consider their health during the day of the interview; free but need to request permission & if you need to translate into other languages then it can be quite pricey 

(3) SF-6D, 4 to 1-week recall period, converts the SF-36 & SF-12 (validated, generic quality of life measures) into utility scores, conversion done by University of Sheffield developer John Brazier; published articles on the methodology to convert these

(4) QWB (Quality of Well-Being scale), asks participants to consider their health over the previous three days, primary care patients in San Diego, CA; contact UCSD health outcomes assessment program for access

## DALYs


<br>

-   Origin story: Global Burden of Disease Study

-   Deliberately a measure of health, not welfare/utility

-   Similar to QALYs, two dimensions of interest:

    -   length of life (differences in life expectancy)

    -   quality of life (measured by disability weight)

## DALYs

[![](images/DALY_disability_affected_life_year_infographic.svg){width="1500"}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability-adjusted_life_year)

::: fragment
**DALYs = YLL + YLD**

-   YLL (Years of Life Lost)
-   YLD (Years Lived with Disability)
:::

## DALYs = [YLL]{style="color: red;"} + YLD

-   **Years of Life Lost (YLL):** changes in life expectancy, calculated
    from comparison to synthetic life table

-   YLL example: Providing HIV treatment delays death from age 30 to age
    50

    -   Life years gained = 20 years

    -   YLL?

**Common practice**

-   Low- and middle- income setting = DALYs \*\*\*Since disability
    weights are freely & publicly available (these weights are required
    for DALY calculations), it can reduce costs/time/resources compared
    to collecting QALY estimates
