# Introduction

This document provides proposed injury incidence rates based on real-world data for creating a Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of strategies to prevent injuries from gunpowder and fireworks. The proposed rates are converted to probabilities for use in the Markov model.

## Proposed Health State Utility Values

1. **No Injury (Healthy)**
   - Utility Value: 1.0 (or slightly less to reflect normal life variability, e.g., 0.95)

2. **Minor Injury**
   - Utility Value: 0.98 
   - Rationale: Minor injuries such as small burns or cuts typically have a temporary and moderate impact on quality of life.

3. **Moderate Injury**
   - Utility Value: 0.9 if sequelae; 0.95 if not. 
   - Rationale: Moderate injuries, including more severe burns and lacerations, have a more significant but still temporary impact on quality of life.

4. **Severe Injury**
   - Utility Value: 0.60 
   - Rationale: Severe injuries such as major burns, limb injuries, or serious eye damage substantially reduce quality of life and may involve long recovery periods.

5. **Severe: Recovered with Sequelae**
   - Utility Value: 0.75
   - Rationale: Individuals who have recovered but suffer from long-term sequelae (e.g., chronic pain, scarring) experience a permanent reduction in quality of life, although it may be less severe than during the acute injury phase.

6. **Death**
   - Utility Value: 0.0
