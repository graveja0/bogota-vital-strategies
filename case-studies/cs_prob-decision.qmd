# Case 1

In a hypothetical community, 60% of all people consume at least 6
alcoholic beverages per week and 50% are overweight. The percentage of
people who are both overweight and consume this much alcohol is 40%.
Construct a 2x2 table to answer (a)-(c) below. For part (d), construct a
decision tree.

-   *What percentage of people consume at least 6 alcoholic beverages
    per week, are overweight, or fall into both categories?*

<!-- ::: -->

-   *You sample at random a person from the community and find that they
    consume at least 6 alcoholic beverages per week. What is the
    probability that they are overweight?*

{{< include "space-insertion.qmd" >}} 

<!-- ::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"} -->
<!-- P(Overweight \| Drinker) = 0.4 / -->
<!-- 0.6 = 0.667 -->
<!-- ::: -->

-   *What is the probability that someone from this community consumes
    at least 6 alcoholic beverages per week if they are overweight?*

{{< include "space-insertion.qmd" >}} 

- *Draw a decision tree to represent this problem*

{{< include "space-insertion.qmd" >}} 


<!-- ::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"} -->
<!-- P(Drinker \| Overweight) = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8 -->
<!-- ::: -->

# Case 2

A new screening procedure can detect 80% of women diagnosed with breast
cancer but will falsely identify 2% without breast cancer. The
prevalence of breast cancer in the population is 1.6 in 100

-   *What is the probability that a woman does not have breast cancer if
    the test is negative?*

{{< include "space-insertion.qmd" >}}

<!-- ::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"} -->
<!-- ![](images/cs_decision-tree_ans_2.1.png) -->
<!-- ::: -->

-   *What is the probability that a woman has breast cancer if the test
    is positive?*
