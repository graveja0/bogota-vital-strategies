# Case 1

In a hypothetical community, 60% of all people consume at least 6
alcoholic beverages per week and 50% are overweight. The percentage of
people who are both overweight and consume this much alcohol is 40%.
Construct a 2x2 table to answer (a)-(c) below. For part (d), construct a
decision tree.

-   *What percentage of people consume at least 6 alcoholic beverages
    per week, are overweight, or fall into both categories?*

-   *You sample at random a person from the community and find that they
    consume at least 6 alcoholic beverages per week. What is the
    probability that they are overweight?*

{{< include "space-insertion.qmd" >}} 

<!-- ::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"} -->
<!-- P(Overweight \| Drinker) = 0.4 / -->

-   *What is the probability that someone from this community consumes
    at least 6 alcoholic beverages per week if they are overweight?*

{{< include "space-insertion.qmd" >}} 

<!-- ::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"} -->
<!-- P(Drinker \| Overweight) = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8 -->
<!-- ::: -->


# Case 2

A new screening procedure can detect 80% of women diagnosed with breast
cancer but will falsely identify 2% without breast cancer. The
prevalence of breast cancer in the population is 1.6 in 100

-   *What is the probability that a woman does not have breast cancer if
    the test is negative?*

    is positive?*

# Case 3

A patient is found to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) 5 cm in
size. If you operate now and he survives, he will have a life expectancy
of 3 additional years. In a series of 100 similar patients from your
hospital, 6 died immediately after surgery. If you elect to watch the
patient, 60% will rupture their AAA at home (assume at an average of 1
year later). Of those who rupture their AAA, 30% will die, while the
other % will undergo emergency surgery and survive, allowing the patient
to survive the full 3-years of life expectancy

-   *Draw a decision tree for the problem of choosing whether to operate
    electively. Remember that you must consider the life expectancies as
    an outcome here. What is the preferred choice?*

<!-- ::: -->

-   *A 95% confidence interval for the mortality rate of elective
    surgery at your hospital ranges from 1.4-12.7%. Does this influence
    your thoughts? Why? Do you need better information about your
    estimate of mortality? Why? (Note: For the latter, calculate the
    mortality rate for which you are indifferent between the two
    choices)*

# Case 4

A patient presents to the ER with abdominal pain. As per the ER doc, you
estimate that the patient's appendicitis probability is 0.16. If the
patient truly has appendicitis, the probability that the appendix was
already perforated at the time the patient presents to the ER is 0.1875.
You can also observe the patient for 6 hours to be certain that your
diagnosis is correct. If your diagnosis ends up being correct, 24% of
individuals will have a perforated appendix after 6 hours (Note: this
number is not what goes into your tree. You must account for the 18.75%
who already had a perforated appendix at the time the patient entered
the hospital).

If the appendix is perforated at the time the patient presents to the ER
or at the end of 6 hours, there is a 0.84 chance that the symptoms will
become worse and a 0.16 chance they will remain the same. If the patient
has appendicitis but the appendix does not burst at the end of 6 hours,
there is a 0.8 chance the symptoms will worsen and a 0.2 chance that
they will remain the same. If the appendix is not diseased, there is a
0.39 chance that the symptoms will remain the same in 6 hours, a 0.61
chance that this will improve, and no chance that they will worsen.

-   Calculate the probability that a patient has a perforated appendix
    by the end of 6 hours given that he had appendicitis but was not
    perforated at the time he entered the hospital

Draw a decision tree to calculate the probabilities asked in questions
3-6.



-   *Calculate the probability that the patient has a perforated
    appendix at the beginning of 6 hours.*

{{< include "space-insertion.qmd" >}}

<!-- ::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"} -->
<!-- ![](images/cs_decision-tree_ans_4.2.png) -->
<!-- ::: -->

P(Perforation at the beginning of the six hours) = 0.1600 \* 0.1875 =
0.0300. This is the proportion of patients with appendicitis multiplied
by the conditional probability of perforation given appendicitis at the
time the patient enters the hospital.

-   *Calculate the probability that the patient will have a perforated
    appendix if you wait 6 hours*

{{< include "space-insertion.qmd" >}}

<!-- ::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"} -->
<!-- P(Perforation after six hours) = 0.0300 + 0.1600 \* 0.8125 \* 0.0646 = -->
<!-- 0.0384 P(Perforation after six hours) = 0.1600 \* 0.2400 = 0.0384. This -->
<!-- is the proportion of patients with appendicitis times the proportion of -->
<!-- patients with a perforated appendix. -->
<!-- ::: -->

-   *Calculate the probability that the patientâ€™s symptoms will 1) get
    worse, 2) stay the same, and 3) get better.*

<!-- You can find these probabilities by adding up the probabilities at the -->
<!-- ends of the branches of the decision tree. P(Symptoms worse) = 0.0252 + -->
<!-- 0.0071 + 0.0973 = 0.1296 P(Symptoms the same) = 0.0048 + 0.0013 + -->
<!-- 0.0243 + 0.3276 = 0.3580 P(Symptoms improve) = 0.5124 -->
<!-- ::: -->

-   *Calculate the conditional probability that the patient has a
    perforated appendix if the symptoms 1) get worse; 2) stay the same
    or 3) get* better.

-   *Calculate the conditional probability that the patient has
    appendicitis if 1) the symptoms get worse, 2) stay the same, or 3)
    get better*

<!-- Using the same probability notations as in question f, we can calculate -->
<!-- the following probabilities: P(Appendicitis \| Symptoms worse) = -->
<!-- (0.0252 + 0.0071 + 0.0973) / 0.1296 = 1 P(Appendicitis \| Symptoms same) -->
<!-- = (0.0048 + 0.0013 + 0.0243) / 0.3580 = 0.0849 P(Appendicitis \| -->
